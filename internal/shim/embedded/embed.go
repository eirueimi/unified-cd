// Package embedded holds the ucd-sh binary that the host agent injects into
// every job container it creates, at /.ucd/ucd-sh (see
// docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-12-step-shell-shim-design.md, Component 2).
//
// The shim always targets linux (job containers share the host arch, not the
// host OS), but the agent binary that embeds it ships for multiple OSes and
// CPU architectures. Which linux ucd-sh gets baked in is selected by the
// COMPILING GOARCH via build tags, not the target OS: a windows/amd64 agent
// embeds ucd-sh-amd64; a darwin/arm64 or linux/arm64 agent embeds
// ucd-sh-arm64. So embed_amd64.go (`//go:build amd64`) and embed_arm64.go
// (`//go:build arm64`) each define `payload` via a single-file `//go:embed`,
// and this file only exposes the shared Bytes() accessor.
//
// internal/shim/embedded/ucd-sh-amd64 and ucd-sh-arm64 are GENERATED,
// COMMITTED linux binaries — build products tracked in git, exactly like
// schemas/unified-cd.schema.json. Regenerate them with
// `go generate ./internal/shim/embedded/` (which runs cmd/shimgen) after
// changing cmd/ucd-sh or internal/shim, and commit the result. cmd/shimgen
// builds with -buildvcs=false -trimpath CGO_ENABLED=0 so the bytes are
// reproducible; a CI drift guard and the release verify gate fail if the
// committed bytes are stale. Because the bytes are committed, `go build`,
// `go test`, `go install .../cmd/agent@version`, container builds, and
// goreleaser all embed the shim with no pre-build step.
package embedded

// Bytes returns the embedded, committed ucd-sh binary for the architecture
// this package was compiled for (see embed_amd64.go / embed_arm64.go). It is
// always non-empty in a correct checkout; a zero length means the committed
// ucd-sh-<arch> file was truncated or lost and must be regenerated with
// `go generate ./internal/shim/embedded/`.
